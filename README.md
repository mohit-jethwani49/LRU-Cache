# LRU-Cache
<p>The code is an implementation of LRU Cache. Least Recently Used(LRU) is one of the cache replacement algorithms that picks the least recently used data and replaces it with the new incoming data when space is full. If some data is fetched or referred recently, its priority is updated and it would become the data with the most priority.</p>
